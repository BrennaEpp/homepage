Hi, I’m a programmer by profession – currently a student at the University of Manitoba. I’m half Canadian and half Costa Rican, and as such I’m natively fluent in both English and Spanish. I grew up mostly in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and moved to Canada to pursue my university studies and experience my dad’s home country. My most consistent hobby is dancing (I like to learn kpop choreographies and also freestyle as a de-stressor), though I also enjoy reading, drawing, playing and baking.
