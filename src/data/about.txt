Hi there! Iâ€™m a programmer by profession â€“ currently a student at the University of Manitoba.  Iâ€™m half Canadian and half Costa Rican, and as such Iâ€™m natively fluent in both English and Spanish.  I grew up mostly in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and moved to Canada to pursue my university studies and experience my dadâ€™s home country. 
My most consistent hobby is dancing (I like to learn kpop choreographies and also freestyle as a de-stressor). I also enjoy reading, drawing, playing and baking (okay, that last one is mostly that I enjoy *eating* the desserts ðŸ˜„). 
I thrive in an environment of innovation and collaboration; I love receiving input from others!
I hope to make the world a little more efficient with my degree while being creative â€“ the good news is I believe both those things are quite attainable in most workplaces.
